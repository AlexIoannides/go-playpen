# Gordle as a Service

- how to stand-up an HTTP server using the `net/http` package from the std library:
  - starting a server with `http.ListenAndServe`
  - defining endpoint routers with `http.ServeMux`
  - defining endpoint handlers that read `http.Request` and write to `http.ResponseWriter`
  - using custom types to define JSON schema
- panicing!
