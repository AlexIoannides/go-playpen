# Caching with Generics

- generics is Go
- goroutine basics
- using the `sync` package for managing goroutine execution (e.g., 'wait groups' and MUTEXes)
- using `testing.T.Parallel()` for concurrent test execution
- testing for data races using concurrent test execution and `go test -race`
- using the `time` package from the std library for working with times and durations
- using the assert package from the `"github.com/stretchr/testify` module for assert statements
